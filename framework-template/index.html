      <h1>The Mysterious Help</h1>
      <p>
        A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he
        had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes. So in the evening,
        he cut out the shoes which he wished to begin to make the next morning,
        and as he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed,
        commended himself to God, and fell asleep. In the morning, after he had
        said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes
        stood quite finished on his table. He was astounded, and knew not what
        to say to it. He took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer, and
        they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them, just
        as if they were intended as a masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him so well, he
        paid more for them than was customary, and, with the money, the
        shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes. He cut
        them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh
        courage; but he had no need to do so, for, when he got up, they were
        already made, and buyers also were not wanting, who gave him money
        enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes.
